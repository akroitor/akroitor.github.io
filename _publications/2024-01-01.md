In recent years, the techniques of analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV) have been applied to determine asymptotics for several families of lattice path models restricted to the orthant \\( \mathbb{N}^d \\) and defined by step sets \\[ S \subseteq \{âˆ’1,0,1 \}^d \setminus \{0\} \\]. Using the theory of ACSV for smooth singular sets, Melczer and Mishna determined asymptotics for the number of walks in any model whose set of steps $S$ is "highly symmetric" (symmetric over every axis). Building on this work, Melczer and Wilson determined asymptotics for all models where $S$ is "mostly symmetric" (symmetric over all but one axis) *except* for models whose set of steps have a vector sum of zero but are not highly symmetric. In this paper we complete the asymptotic classification of the mostly symmetric case by analyzing a family of saddle-point-like integrals whose amplitudes are singular near their saddle points.
