Abstract
-----
I will discuss the proof that the constant \\( \zeta(3) \\) (known as Apery's constant) is irrational. The proof is quite bizarre and somewhat mystical (at least to me).

Introduction
=====
The Riemann zeta function is the unique analytic continuation of the function \\(\zeta(s) = \sum_\{n \geq 1\} \frac{1}{n^s}\\) (a priori defined only on \\(s \in \mathbb{R} \times i \mathbb{R}_+ \\) ) to the whole complex plane. This zeta function is one of the most (in)famous functions in mathematics, being the subject of the well-known **Riemann hypothesis**, one of the Millennium Problems. The zeta function pops up in many places, notably number theory. Notably the prime number theorem says that, if \\(\pi(x)\\) is the prime ounting function then \\[ \pi(x) = \int_0^x \frac{dt}{\ln t} + O( x e^{-a \sqrt{\ln x}} ) \\] for some \\(a>0 \\). If however the Riemann Hypothesis holds then we get a stronger \\[ \pi(x) = \int_0^x \frac{dt}{\ln t} + O( \sqrt{x} \ln x. \\]

Almost all of this is derived from Van de Poorten's article on the matter. 

$$
\displaylines{
\nabla \cdot E= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\\
\nabla \cdot B=0 \\\
\nabla \times E= -\partial_tB \\\
\nabla \times B  = \mu_0 \left(J + \varepsilon_0 \partial_t E \right)
}
