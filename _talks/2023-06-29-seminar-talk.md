This is a talk I was invited to give at the UWaterloo Enumerative Combinatorics seminar. The focus of the talk was on the extension of a 2024 paper by Baryshnikov, Melczer, and Pemantle on analytic combinatorics in hyperplane arrangements.

Abstract
-----

ACSV revolves around analyzing a generating function A around its critical points. The simplest non-trivial case is when the denominator of A can be written as a product of linear functions, implying the singular set of A is a hyperplane arrangement. Taking a stratification of this hyperplane arrangement gives us a union of strata, each containing exactly one critical point. If we vary the direction that we are taking asymptotics in these critical points can move around our strata. "Generically" these critical points do not coincide and we are able to take as many residues as needed to find asymptotics, but in so-called "non-generic" directions it is possible that our critical points can coincide and prevent us from taking as many residues as we would like. I will discuss previous work and the natural extension on finding asymptotics in non-generic directions.
