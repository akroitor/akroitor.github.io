I am currently a PhD student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.mathematics.utoronto.ca/), studying Geometric Analysis under [Tristan Collins](https://www.mathematics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/tristan-collins).

Before this I was a master's student at the University of Waterloo in the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/), working under [Stephen Melczer](https://melczer.ca/) on [Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables](https://acsvproject.com/) (ACSV), interested in using analysis and geometry to attack combinatorial problems (though in reality this came down often to finding asymptotics of Fourier-Laplace integrals that pop up from non-generic directions in ACSV). My thesis is [here](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/62ba7767-e342-437e-8e9b-9635bb07ffdc).


I am from Montreal (the Plateau, near Mount Royal), where I did my undergrad at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/) in Mathematics. Besides mathematics, I am fond of choral singing and taking walks.

My office is PG 207.
