Quotes (Mathematical and Otherwise)
=====
Here is an assortment of quotes that I like. It seems like many good math books have introductory quotes, which (somewhat) implies the existence of personal stashes of quotes. This is mine.

>Computation is the robot’s task. Understanding mathematics is the human’s task.
To suppose that mathematics is the art of calculation is like supposing that architecture is the art of
bricklaying, or that literature is the art of typing. Calculation in mathematics is necessary, but it is an
almost mechanical procedure which can be automated by machines. The mathematician does much more
than a computerised mathematics package. The mathematician formulates problems, reduces them to a form
which a computer can handle, checks that the results correspond to the original problem, and interprets and
applies the answers. Therefore the mathematician must not be too concerned with mere computation. That
is the task of the robot. The task of the human is to understand mathematics.
