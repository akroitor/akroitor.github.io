This is a talk I gave at the Canadian Mathematical Society Winter 2023 meeting. The focus of the talk was on the paper that I had submitted on orthant walks, and is meant to be 30 minutes long. Note that this is intended for a more general audience.

Abstract
-----

The topic of lattice path enumeration finds applications in a variety of areas, from queuing theory to statistical physics. Recent work on the behaviour of lattice walks restricted to quadrants combines a combinatorial tool called the kernel method with techniques from the field of analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV) to determine asymptotics of a large variety of models. In this talk we describe new results using this framework, going beyond past work by analyzing more pathological saddle-point integrals using new complex analytic techniques.
