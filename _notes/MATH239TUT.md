In Fall 2023 I and three other TAs were asked to make (and deliver) tutorial questions for MATH239 at the University of Waterloo. All questions and solutions are due in equal part to myself, Alena Gusakov, Erica Liu, and Josephine Reynes. I also created a set of bonus problems (not necessarily meant to be solved) myself.

The questions are available [here](/files/math239TUTqs.pdf).

The solutions are available [here](/files/math239TUTsols.pdf).

The bonus questions are available [here](/files/math239TUTbonus.pdf).
