I am currently a masters student at The University of waterloo in the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/). I am currently working with [Stephen Melczer](https://melczer.ca/) on [Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables](https://acsvproject.com/) (ACSV), interested in using analysis and geometry to attack combinatorial problems.

I am from Montreal (the Plateau, near le Mont Royal), where I did my undergrad at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/) in Mathematics. I will be moving in the Fall to Toronto to start my PhD in Mathematics at [The University of Toronto](https://www.mathematics.utoronto.ca/). Besides mathematics, I am fond of choral singing and taking walks.

My office is MC 5462.

My email is: apkroito[at]uwaterloo[dot]ca
