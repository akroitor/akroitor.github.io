This is an assortment of writings and mathematical thoughts. Almost certainly very little of the work here is original, and is only meant to show something I've thought about or read about at some point. Since I find it much easier to write in LaTeX than in MathJax, I will likely make these shorter than I would otherwise.

{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
