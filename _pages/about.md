I am currently a master's student at The University of waterloo in the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/). I am currently working with [Stephen Melczer](https://melczer.ca/) on [ACSV](https://acsvproject.com/), interested in using analysis and geometry to attack combinatorial problems.

I am from Montreal (the Plateau), where I did my undergrad at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/) in Mathematics. I will be moving in the Fall to Toronto to start my PhD in Mathematics at [The University of Toronto](https://www.mathematics.utoronto.ca/). Besides mathematics I am fond of choral singing, and taking walks.
