Abstract
-----
I will discuss the proof that the constant \\( \zeta(3) \\) (known as Apery's constant) is irrational. The proof is quite bizarre and somewhat mystical (at least to me).

Introduction
=====
The Riemann zeta function is the unique analytic continuation of the function \\(\zeta(s) = \sum_\{n \geq 1\} \frac{1}{n^s}\\) (a priori defined only on \\(s \in \mathbb{R} \times i \mathbb{R}_+ \\) ) to the whole complex plane. Naturally, as the subject of the Riemann hypothesis, the zeta function is one of the most well-known functions in mathematics. It turns out that despite extremely being well-studied, we still don't know basic things about \\(\zeta(s) \\). It is not too hard to show that
$$
\begin{align*} 
2x - 5y &=  8 \\ 
3x + 9y &=  -12
\end{align*}
$$

Almost all of this is derived from Van de Poorten's article on the matter. 

$$
\displaylines{
\nabla \cdot E= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\\
\nabla \cdot B=0 \\\
\nabla \times E= -\partial_tB \\\
\nabla \times B  = \mu_0 \left(J + \varepsilon_0 \partial_t E \right)
}
$$
