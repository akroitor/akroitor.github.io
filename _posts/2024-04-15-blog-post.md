Prelude

This is almost entirely taken from a final project for a topics class on analytic combinatorics (CO739) offered at the University of Waterloo taught by Stephen Melczer.

Introduction
=====
The Riemann zeta function is the unique analytic continuation of the function \\(\zeta(s) = \sum_\{n \geq 1\} \frac{1}{n^s}\\) (a priori defined only on \\(s \in \mathbb{R} \times i \mathbb{R}_+ \\) ) to the whole complex plane.

This zeta function is one of the most (in)famous functions in mathematics, being the subject of the well-known **Riemann hypothesis**, one of the Millennium Problems. The zeta function pops up in many places, notably number theory.

\nabla \cdot E= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\\
\nabla \cdot B=0 \\\
\nabla \times E= -\partial_tB \\\
\nabla \times B  = \mu_0 \left(J + \varepsilon_0 \partial_t E \right)
}
$$
