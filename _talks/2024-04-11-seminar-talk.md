This is a talk I was invited to give at the UWaterloo Enumerative Combinatorics seminar. The focus of the talk was on the paper that I had submitted on orthant walks. Note that the format of the talk this term included a 45 minute seminar followed by a 50 minute talk.

Abstract
-----

Analytic combinatorics in several variables uses complex
analytic results to find coefficients in the series expansions of
meromorphic functions. Typically this is used to find asymptotics of
sequences by examining their associated generating functions. In the
2000's Bousquet-Melou (and others) used the kernel method, introduced in
the late 60s and 70s, to find generating function expressions (in terms
of certain multivariate rational functions) for certain kinds of walks
in restricted regions. In particular Melczer and Mishna found
asymptotics for these restricted walks when the step sets are symmetric
in every axis. Further work by Melczer and Wilson found asymptotics
under the weaker assumption that the step set is symmetric in all but
one axis, except in the special case that the vector sum of all the
steps is equal to zero. In the pre-seminar I will discuss the kernel
method. In the main talk I will discuss how to solve the case where the
vector sum is equal to zero. If time permits I will talk a little about
the interesting combinatorial behaviour in this case and the treatment
of the integrals that appear.
